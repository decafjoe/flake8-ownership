 Roadmap
=========


Configurability
===============

To be useful, this should allow configurable regex specifications
instead of hard-coding them into the module. In particular, this will
be needed before integrating flake8-ownership into decafjoe, because
decafjoe uses the ``history.py`` module from SQLAlchemy, which has
different author/copyright/license than the rest of the code.


Add Tests to Documentation
==========================

Why not? I wrote all the docstrings, might as well present them
nicely.
