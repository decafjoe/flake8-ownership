Support Flake8 < 3.0?
=====================

I have no personal reason to do this, but if there are other people
that are stuck on older versions, it shouldn't be too hard to use
flake8-polyfill to make flake8-ownership work for those folks. The
required changes to testing might be a little tricky though.
